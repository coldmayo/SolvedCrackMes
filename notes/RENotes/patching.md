Patching in this context is changing the contents of an executable file. I will be teaching you how to do this in Ghidra.

If you right click on an assembly instruction click "Patch Instruction"

After some loading, you should be able to make changes to that line you right clicked on.

Once you make the changes click enter to finalize the changes. To test out the patched file, the edited executable needs to be exported. Navigate to the "File" tab and then click on "Export Program".

Now you have a patched file saved to your system.
