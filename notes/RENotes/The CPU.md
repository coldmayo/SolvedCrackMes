- The CPU is the device that executes the machine code a program consists of.
- Instruction: A CPU command. Each CPU has its own Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
- Machine Code: Code that the CPU directly processes. Each instruction is encoded by several bytes
- Assembly Language: Direct translation from machine code to something (kind of) human readable
- CPU [[Registers]]: Each CPU has a fixed set of general purpose registers (GPR). Where: x86 has 8, and ARM has 16. The easiest way to understand a register is to think of it as an untyped temporary variable.
