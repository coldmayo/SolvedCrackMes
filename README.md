# SolvedCrackMes

This is a repo of some of the crackme's I've solved as a practice of Reverse Engineering. I do this sort of thing for fun because I veiw this as a puzzle solving exersize. The crackmes will be exclusively for Linux machines (x86-64 type CPU).

## Directory info

- \NoraCodes
	- contains the solutions of the <a href= "https://github.com/noracodes/crackmes">beginner crackmes</a> from NoraCodes
- \challenges.re
	- has some solutions from <a href="https://challenges.re/">challenges.re</a>
- \crackmes.one
	- solutions to crackmes from <a href="https://crackmes.one/">crackmes.one</a>
- \crackmes.de
	- solutions to crackmes from the now defunct crackmes.de
- \notes
	- Some of the notes I have taken on the basics of Reverse Engineering
- \other
	- miscellaneous crackmes

The solutions are inside of a directory which includes the C code of what I believe the executable is doing, the executable, link.txt which shows where I found the crackme (if applicable), and an explain.txt (or .md) file which explains my solution.
