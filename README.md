# SolvedCrackMes

This is a repo of some of the crackme's I've solved with C code that explains what it does. This is mainly a practice of reverse engineering.

## Directory info

Every crackme is in their own separate folder with the executable, a C file that shows what the executable does, and possibly a text file with an explication. 

## Tools I used

- Radare2
- Ghidra
- objdump
