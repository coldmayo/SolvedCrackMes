You got a package with the following files:

        util (executables for win32 and linux)
        vol1
        vol2
        vol4
        vol5

Judging by numbers, one file is probably missing ('vol3').
What can you say about this utility program and these files?
Can you extract some information from it?
Can you recover the missing file?
