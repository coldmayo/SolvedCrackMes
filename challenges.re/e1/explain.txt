Takes 1 argument: file name
If there is more or less than 1 argument, this error will occur: "Usage: <filename>"
If the file does not exist, an error occurs: "error #1!"
If the file does exist, it changes the last modified/accessed time/date to the current time/date
If for some reason, the above cannot be done, it gives an error: "error #2!"

For C code of the executable, take a look at e12.c
